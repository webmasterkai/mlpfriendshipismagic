Hello! Welcome to MLP Friendship is Magic! My name is Reverie. I love to draw My Little Ponies! I’ve watched the show, and would like to share my interest and love to draw with all of you. First of all, my first drawing was a pony that I made up. I named her Sea Swirl. (I know Sea Swirl is a MLP Friendship is Magic pony). I will draw the ‘mane’ six and other made up ponies. I might do other ponies like Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. I am going to show you Sea Swirl first though. Her she is:

She is hand colored, but in the future I might figure out how to put her so she looks all the same color.
